# Calculator
A C++ calculator that can perform basic operations, with decimal point and backspace buttons.
Button BackSpace deletes last digit from the entry.
Button C deletes everything inserted, but button CE deletes only last entry.
Button Dot it's decimal point. Only one decimal point can be inserted.
Button +/- changes the sign of the last entry(i.e. if you type 123, then press +/- button, the entry will be -123. If you press it again, the entry will be 123 and so on).
Cases of foreign division are solved(any positive number / 0 => +infinit, any negative number / 0 => -infinit and 0 / 0 it's NaN).
